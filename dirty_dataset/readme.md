This directory contains the dirty dataset corresponding to the concatenation of the files from the *out_process* folder. It is called dirty because the coordinates have not been checked, and will be often wrong. Thus this dataset could already be retrieved for some applications, but for sure you should not use the coordinates. If you need the geo-localisation of the sentences, then you should use the scripts in the *clean* folder to produce the final dataset.
